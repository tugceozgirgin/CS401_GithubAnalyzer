(Yin Huai via Ashutosh Chauhan)

Summary:
update test results

This issue proposes a new logical optimizer called Correlation Optimizer, which is used to merge correlated MapReduce jobs (MR jobs) into a single MR job. The idea is based on YSmart (http://ysmart.cse.ohio-state.edu/). The paper and slides of YSmart are linked at the bottom.

Since Hive translates queries in a sentence by sentence fashion, for every operation which may need to shuffle the data (e.g. join and aggregation operations), Hive will generate a MapReduce job for that operation. However, for those operations which may need to shuffle the data, they may involve correlations explained below and thus can be executed in a single MR job.

	Input Correlation: Multiple MR jobs have input correlation (IC) if their input relation sets are not disjoint;
	Transit Correlation: Multiple MR jobs have transit correlation (TC) if they have not only input correlation, but also the same partition key;
	Job Flow Correlation: An MR has job ﬂow correlation (JFC) with one of its child nodes if it has the same partition key as that child node.

The current implementation of correlation optimizer only detect correlations among MR jobs for reduce-side join operators and reduce-side aggregation operators (not map only aggregation). A query will be optimized if it satisfies following conditions.

	There exists a MR job for reduce-side join operator or reduce side aggregation operator which have JFC with all of its parents MR jobs (TCs will be also exploited if JFC exists);
	All input tables of those correlated MR job are original input tables (not intermediate tables generated by sub-queries); and
	No self join is involved in those correlated MR jobs.

Correlation optimizer is implemented as a logical optimizer. The main reasons are that it only needs to manipulate the query plan tree and it can leverage the existing component on generating MR jobs.

Current implementation can serve as a framework for correlation related optimizations. I think that it is better than adding individual optimizers.

There are several work that can be done in future to improve this optimizer. Here are three examples.

	Support queries only involve TC;
	Support queries in which input tables of correlated MR jobs involves intermediate tables; and
	Optimize queries involving self join.

(Navis Ryu via Carl Steinbach)

Summary:
DPAL-1906 Implement simple lock manager for hive server

(Sambavi Muthukrishnan via Carl Steinbach)

Summary:
The idea here is to walk the operator tree and identify join and group by operators
whose keys can be mapped back directly to tables and columns on those tables. This
information can be used to determine the characteristics of a workload and which
tables are accessed most often using the same keys for these operators that can 
benefit from bucketing.

Test Plan: Added new test cases in TestCliDriver. Ran all existing unit tests and they passed.

(Sushanth Sowmyan via Ashutosh Chauhan)

Summary:
HIVE-3341 Making hive tests run against different MR versions

After we build hive, we want to have the ability to run unit tests against specific hadoop versions. Currently, the classpath constructed has multiple hadoop jars, which makes compiling okay, but running non-deterministic.

An example is HIVE-3156, where running against 0.23 shows issues with a couple of tests (which should either be shimmed out, or separated into directories the way it's done in the shims/ directory) - It would also be nice to find these issues out at test-compile time itself, rather than having them fail at test runtime.

With this patch, we can set ant variable hadoop.mr.rev to 20, 20S or 23 to test against a particular version.

Test Plan: current tests continue to work - this is a build system change

Summary:

Hive thrift code doesnt generate quality hashCode(). Right now, it all has
@Override

It will cause all entries go to the same bucket if it's used as hash key.

(Bhushan Mandhani via Carl Steinbach)

Summary:
When ProtectMode has every member set to the default false value, the toString() method returns null. When this happens, we should realize that the PROTECT_MODE parameter is
no longer needed and should be removed for the Table or Partition. Currently, we try to persist this null value and get an error.

Test Plan: Ran Hive. Checked that ""alter table some_table disable NO_DROP CASCADE"" successfully removed the PROTECT_MODE parameter and did not give any error. Running unit tests.

(Kevin Wilfong via Carl Steinbach)

Summary:
Today when a managed table has a partition with a location which is not a subdirectory of the table's location, when the table is dropped the partition's data is not deleted from HDFS, resulting in an orphaned directory (the data exists but nothing points to it).

The same applies to dropping a database with cascade and a table has a location outside the database.

I think it is safe to assume managed tables/partitions own the directories they point to, so we should clean these up.

Test Plan: Added test cases to verify that the directories which would be orphaned are cleaned up by drop table/index/database.

(Shreepadma Venugopalan via Carl Steinbach)

Summary:
Regex Serde Changes

RegexSerDe is as much a part of the standard Hive distribution as the other SerDes
currently in hive-serde. I think we should move it over to the hive-serde module so that
users don't have to go to the added effort of manually registering the contrib jar before
using it.

results.
(Kiyotaka Suzuki via Carl Steinbach)

Summary:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2803

HIVE-2803 utc_from_timestamp and utc_to_timestamp returns incorrect results.

It changed so that applyOffset() return a new instance.

How to reproduce:


$ echo ""2011-12-25 09:00:00.123456"" > /tmp/data5.txt
hive> create table ts1(t1 timestamp);
hive> load data local inpath '/tmp/data5.txt' overwrite into table ts1;
hive> select t1, from_utc_timestamp(t1, 'JST'), from_utc_timestamp(t1, 'JST')
from ts1 limit 1;



The following result is expected:

 2011-12-25 09:00:00.123456      2011-12-25 18:00:00.123456      2011-12-25
18:00:00.123456


However, the above query return incorrect result like this:

 2011-12-26 03:00:00.492456      2011-12-26 03:00:00.492456      2011-12-26
03:00:00.492456



This is because GenericUDFFromUtcTimestamp.applyOffset() does setTime()
improperly.
On evaluating query, timestamp argument always returns the same instance.
GenericUDFFromUtcTimestamp.applyOffset() does setTime() on the instance.
That means it adds all offsets in the query.

Summary:

TestRemoteHiveMetaStoreIpAddress now uses the standard way of finding a free
port using Java's ServerSocket class.

TestRemoteHiveMetaStoreIpAddress always uses the same port, meaning that if
another process happens to be using that port, the tests cannot succeed.

There seems to be a standard way of finding a free port using Java's
ServerSocket class, this should be used instead.

Test Plan: Ran TestRemoteHiveMetaStoreIpAddress and
TestRemoteUGIHiveMetaStoreIpAddress, the two tests which would be affected by
this change.  I verified they passed and did not use port 39083.

being written to the logs. It will be good if we can add a shutdown event to the

We need to clean up the RAT report to 0. Apache projects aren't supposed to

Note that although most of the files are just missing headers, some of them
explicitly say copyright by facebook and released under the Thrift (not Apache)

from facebook could in verify that they intend to license them to Apache.

(Travis Crawford via Ashutosh Chauhan)

Summary:
Add support for optionally using the thrift framed transport, enabling
integration with environments where that is necessary.

Users may want/need to use thrift's framed transport when communicating with the
Hive MetaStore. This patch adds a new property
hive.metastore.thrift.framed.transport.enabled that enables the framed transport
(defaults to off, aka no change from before the patch). This property must be
set for both clients and the HMS server.

It wasn't immediately clear how to use the framed transport with SASL, so as
written an exception is thrown if you try starting the server with both options.
If SASL and the framed transport will indeed work together I can update the
patch (although I don't have a secured environment to test in).

Test Plan:
Tested locally that client and server can connect, both with and
without the flag. Tests pass.

(Chris Dean via Ashutosh Chauhan)

Summary:
JSON output for DDL commands

By setting the variable hive.format=json then ddl commands will
produce json output suitable for client side parsing.  For example, to
list all the databases one might get:

    {
      ""databases"": [
        ""default""
      ]
    }

The goal is to have an option to produce JSON output of the DDL commands that is
easily machine parseable.

For example, ""desc my_table"" currently gives

    id    bigint
    user  string

and we want to allow a json output:

    {
      ""columns"": [
        {""name"": ""id"", ""type"": ""bigint""},
        {""name"": ""user"", ""type"": ""string""}
      ]
    }

Test Plan: Run the provided unit tests

after adding jars
(Kevin Wilfong via Yongqiang He)

Summary:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2706

The issue was that the current thread's classloader and the classloader in the
conf differed due to the prehook updating only the current thread's classloader
with new jars.  Now, it updates both classloaders, fixing the issue.

When a custom UDF is used in a query after add an archive, such as a zip file,
after adding jars, the XMLEncoder enters an infinite loop when serializing the
map reduce task, as part of sending it to be executed. This results in a stack
overflow error.

Test Plan: Verified it fixed the stack overflow error.

(Kevin Wilfong via Yongqiang He)

Summary:
Resource files are now added to the class path as soon as they are added via the
CLI.  This fixes the stack overflow error mentioned in the JIRA by ensuring a
consistent class loader between serializers and deserializers for the same
query.

Note that now serdes which contain a static block to register themselves are now
registered twice, once when adding the file to the class loader, and once when
an instance of the class is created.  Previously, registering a serde twice
resulted in an exception, to avoid this, I have downgraded it to a warning.

When a custom UDF is used as part of a join which is converted to a map join,
the XMLEncoder enters an infinite loop when serializing the map reduce task for
the second time, as part of sending it to be executed.  This results in a stack
overflow error.

Test Plan:
I ran the unit tests to verify nothing was broken.

I ran several queries which used custom UDFs and involved a join which was
converted to a map join.  I verified these completed successfully consistently

tests
(Marek Sapota via John Sichi)

Summary:
Replace diff -I with regex masking in Java

The current diff -I approach has two problems:  (1) it does not allow resolution
finer than line-level, so it's impossible to mask out pattern occurrences within
a line, and (2) it produces unmasked files, so if you run diff on the command
line to compare the result .q.out with the checked-in file, you see the noise.

My suggestion is to first run sed to replace noise patterns with an
unlikely-to-occur string like ZYZZYZVA, and then diff the pre-masked files
without using any -I.

This would require a one-time hit to update all existing .q.out files so that
they would contain the pre-masked results.

Add requirements.

Often times UDFs will have dependencies to external JARs/FILEs.  It makes sense
for these to be encoded by the UDF (rather than having the caller remember the
set of files that need to be ADDed).  Let's add an annotation to UDFs which will
cause these resources to be auto-added.
